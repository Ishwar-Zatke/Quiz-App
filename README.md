# Quiz-App
Nowadays multiple choice quiz is really taken over in education  system because of online mode due to pandemic. Thus to  improve our knowledge more and more practice is required.  
Thus, “THE QUIZ” is a program which helps students to take quiz  of each other on different topic to practice and improve  knowledge. 
THE QUIZ is a quiz program made to take quiz of student on different  concepts. It is written in c++ programming language. It consist of different  header files which can be used to generate the random number which can  be assigned to a particular question in the code so that when every time  the code is executed similar question will not come in same order. 
Here I have used espeak which is a software to convert text to speech. It  is used to convert the text stored in string to speech using windows header  file which allows the inbuilt system function to run the code. 
This can be used as a fun activity to create questions and take quiz  of others. Thus the program is written in C++ language which  takes MCQ quiz.
